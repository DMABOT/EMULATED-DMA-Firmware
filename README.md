Easy Tutorial: Create a Custom Firmware for Your Captain DMA Device to Emulate a Graphics Card

** Warning:** Be careful when working with your device, or you might break it.

What You Need:

A Captain DMA device
A computer with VIVADO software
pcileech source code (this is like a blueprint for your custom firmware)
Arbor software (this helps you configure your device)
Step 1: Clone the pcileech Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
Run the command git clone https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech.git to download the pcileech source code.
Step 2: Set Up Your VIVADO Project

Open VIVADO on your computer and create a new project.
Choose the Captain DMA device as the device you want to work with.
Import the pcileech source code into your project.
Step 3: Configure Your Emulation Settings

Open the pcileech_fpga folder in your project and edit the config.h file.
Change the settings to match your needs, such as:
Device ID (like a special name) - set to a graphics card device ID
Vendor ID (like the company that made it) - set to a graphics card vendor ID
Revision ID (like a version number) - set to a graphics card revision ID
BAR0 Sizing Value (this is like a special setting) - set to a graphics card BAR0 sizing value
Subsystem ID (this is like a special code) - set to a graphics card subsystem ID
Any other important settings
Step 4: Write Your Emulation Code

Create a new file in the pcileech_fpga folder and write your emulation code using VHDL or Verilog.
This code will tell your Captain DMA device how to emulate a graphics card.
You will need to implement the following:
Graphics card registers and memory mapping
Graphics card interrupts and interrupt handling
Graphics card DMA engine and memory access
Any other graphics card functionality you want to emulate
Step 5: Build and Synthesize Your Firmware

Use VIVADO to build and synthesize your custom firmware.
This will create a special file that your Captain DMA device can understand.
Step 6: Flash Your Firmware

Use the Arbor software to flash your custom firmware onto your Captain DMA device.
This will upload the instructions to your device.
Step 7: Test Your Emulation

Test your device to make sure it's working correctly and emulating a graphics card.
You can use tools like lspci or pciutils to verify that your device is recognized as a graphics card.
That's it! If you follow these steps, you should be able to create a custom firmware for your Captain DMA device that emulates a graphics card using pcileech. Remember to be careful and patient, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
